            Sanctuary has aided people in using their voice and influence to
            create change by swaying the corporations put into power inducing an
            actual change and attempting to amplify a postive impact as muvh as
            possible. Corporation are being held liable for their buisness
            approaches. We continue to put one foot in front of the other in the
            fight against climate change by giving off petitions, signing in
            protestdemanding clarity, and impacting policy. There is so much
            that still needs to be done and adressed.

            Wildlife conservation is linked to the acceleration of ecotourism on
            a national level. Africa’s ecotourism is the biggest example of this
            fact.Animal conservation is a complicated field that requires a
            specific set of knowledge. Just as all interaction with animals,
            conservation needs to be done right. Globalteer has partnered up
            with local, already existing programmes. These fit with our vision
            of providing “appropriate support to responsible and sustainable
            projects working in community development, wildlife rescue, and
            environmental conservation.” The programmes are thereby run by local
            expertise that know the areas and animals better than anyone. And of
            course, have the animals’ best interests at heart. We support the
            programmes through providing them with volunteers and administration
            work and donations to support their work.

            Taking care of the world’s wildlife is everyone’s responsibility.
            The big corporate companies have a lot of power over what is
            produced. However, demand from the consumers is equally as
            important. Know that your actions have power too. Such as your
            consumption habits, the traces you leave in terms of waste, as well
            as your awareness and worded opinions.
